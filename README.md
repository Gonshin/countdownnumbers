App user instuctions:

The user needs to enter the target value and the six input numbers
which are to be used to achieve that target value.
The input numbers don't all have to be different.
When the user clicks on the 'Find Solution' button,
the app will try to obtain the target by combining some or all of the six input numbers,
using addition, multiplication, division, subtraction and brackets.
A valid solution does not need to contain all six numbers,
but it cannot use the same input number more than once.
If an input is left blank, then it is assumed to be zero.
